# ec-cli-tutorial

An experiment using [Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge](https://github.com/The-Pocket/Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge)
to generate documentation for [Conforma](https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-cli).

For convenience the generated markdown files are currently placed in [the
wiki](https://github.com/simonbaird/ec-cli-tutorial/wiki) associated with this
repo. Clone or add a remote for
`git@github.com:simonbaird/ec-cli-tutorial.wiki.git` if you want to check them
out.

(If we were going to adopt this seriously it would most likely be integrated into
[conforma.dev](https://conforma.dev/).)
